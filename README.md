# StyleLancer
A (S)CSS library meant to copy Freelancer's (2003 game) UI elements as best as possible using modern web technologies.

## Goals and Intentions
This project is meant to be a repository of the Freelancer design system styles for any intents and purposes. You may use it to design your fan site, mod, add overlay UI elements to the game in your mod, or even use them in a web version of the game if you intend to make one.

## UI References
I've captured the game's UI elements and uploaded to [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QqNM2uPIGwOfCld0ccxQcrnsbR5MW9Y3?usp=sharing). However, the best way to study the animations and behavior of the elements is to run the game and take notes.
The best way to get the game and run it on modern computers (Windows 10+, CrossOver on Mac or Linux) is to download the [Discovery Freelancer](https://discoverygc.com) mod.
